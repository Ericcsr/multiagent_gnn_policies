# Learning Multi-Agent Policies using GNNs
## Available algorithms:
- Behavior Cloning as described in [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10527) `python3 gnn_cloning.py`
- DAGGER imitation learning `python3 gnn_dagger.py`
- Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients `python3 gnn_ddpg.py` (no good results with this yet)

## Other code:
- `python3 flocking_gym_test.py` provides test code for the Gym Flock environments
